# [Archived] Meteorus Mod for Minecraft 1.6.2

This is a very old project that I worked on when I was young. The mod is dated back to 2013.

It adds basic color variations of the stone blocks, a new custom model for custom crafting UI. It adds a new mob too... an alien (don't ask me why, I don't remember).

I have not even try to read this thing because... I am scared of what I will find.

__I am uploading this just for archiving, it is still one of my first programming attempt :)__
